The Fre edo m C ash Len de rs network provides borrowers with access to a payday lender in their area who can offer ultra-short-term loans of between two weeks and 30 days. These loans act as a bridge to your next payday, but can quickly become expensive if you donâ€™t pay the loan off in time.

Your loan will likely start off with an interest rate already in the triple digits. If you fail to satisfy the loan on time, the debt will roll over into a new loan with an even higher interest rate.

That can turn a loan of a few hundred dollars into a debt of a few thousand dollars in a matter of months. Only use these loans as a last resort.
